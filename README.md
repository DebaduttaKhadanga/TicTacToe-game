# Why did I make this game?
### I made this to test myself on how much I had learnt on Python. This was also something our professor assigned us to do.

# How does it work?
### This code essentially takes three lists of length 3, with all zero values and puts them in a single list and then displays it as a matrix. It then iterates using a variable, where each even iteration is considered as Player 1's turn and each odd iteration is considered as Player 2's turn. This particular code uses a base-level coordinate geometry based grid system to fill the matrix according to the user's input. The user must input the position he/she wants to have their mark on in the form [row, column]. It runs until either of the players win. If none of the players win after 9 iterations of the loop, the game is considered a draw.
